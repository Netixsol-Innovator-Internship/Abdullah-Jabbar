## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

**Listing Process:**
```
1. User enters price in portfolio
2. Contract approves NFT transfer
3. NFT transferred to marketplace custody
4. Listing stored in marketplace contract
5. Marketplace detects listing on next load
6. Display updates with listing status
```

**Buying Process:**
```
1. User selects NFT to buy
2. System checks if owner or listed
3. Calculates correct payment amount
4. User approves tokens in MetaMask
5. Contract transfers NFT & payment
6. Data refreshed to show new ownership
```

### Key Functions

**Portfolio:**
```tsx
handleListNFT(tokenId: number)
- Validates price > 0
- Approves NFT to marketplace
- Lists NFT with price
- Refreshes data
```

**Marketplace:**
```tsx
handleBuyNFT(tokenId: number)
- Gets NFT data
- Validates owner !== buyer
- Detects purchase type (direct/listed)
- Calculates payment amount
- Approves tokens
- Calls appropriate buy method
- Refreshes marketplace
```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"You cannot buy your own NFT!"**
- Expected error when owner tries to buy own NFT
- Solution: View on different account or list instead

**"Please enter a valid price"**
- Price is 0, negative, or non-numeric
- Solution: Enter positive number

**"Price must be greater than 0"**
- Price validation failed
- Solution: Check price input is > 0

**"Not NFT owner"**
- Account doesn't own the NFT being listed
- Solution: Verify correct account is connected

**"Already listed"**
- NFT already has active listing
- Solution: Check portfolio for existing listing

### Contract Assumptions

Implementation assumes marketplace contract has:
```solidity
function listings(tokenId) returns (tokenId, seller, price, isActive)
function listNFT(tokenId, price)
function buyListedNFT(tokenId, paymentToken)
```

If using different contract, update these functions accordingly.
