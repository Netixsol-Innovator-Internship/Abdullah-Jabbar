# üöÄ Deployment Guide for Kasplex Testnet

## Prerequisites

1. **MetaMask or Web3 Wallet** with Kasplex testnet configured
2. **KAS tokens** on Kasplex testnet for gas fees
   - Get from: https://faucet.kasplextest.xyz (if available)
3. **Private Key** exported from your wallet
4. **Node.js & npm** installed

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Install Dependencies
```powershell
npm install
```

### 2. Setup Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
KASPLEX_RPC_URL=https://rpc.kasplextest.xyz
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key_here
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER commit your real `.env` file with private keys!**

### 3. Get Testnet Tokens
- Visit Kasplex faucet (check their Discord/docs)
- Ensure you have enough KAS for gas fees (~0.1 KAS should be sufficient)

### 4. Compile Contracts
```powershell
npx hardhat compile
```

### 5. Deploy to Kasplex Testnet
```powershell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network kasplex
```

### 6. Save Deployment Addresses
The script automatically creates `deployment.json` with all contract addresses.

### 7. Update Frontend Configuration
Copy addresses from `deployment.json` to `frontend/src/config/addresses.ts`

### 8. Verify Contracts (Optional)
Check your deployed contracts on:
https://explorer.testnet.kasplextest.xyz

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "insufficient funds for intrinsic transaction cost"
**Solution:** Get more KAS tokens from the faucet

### Issue: "nonce too low"
**Solution:** Reset MetaMask account or wait a few seconds and retry

### Issue: "network timeout"
**Solution:** Check RPC URL and internet connection

### Issue: Deployment fails mid-way
**Solution:** Comment out completed steps in deploy.js and re-run
