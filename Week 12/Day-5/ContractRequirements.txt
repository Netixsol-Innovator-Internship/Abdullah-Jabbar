1. Platform Token (ERC-20)

Filename: PlatformToken.sol
Purpose: Native token of your ecosystem, used for DEX trading and NFT payments.

Requirements:

Fully compliant ERC-20 token

Name: custom (e.g., “PlatformCoin”)

Symbol: 3–4 letters (e.g., “PLAT”)

Decimals: 18

Initial supply: ~1,000,000 (your choice)

Owner minting: only owner can mint more tokens

Mint function: callable by Faucet contract for distribution

Clean, commented Solidity code

Core Functions:

transfer(), approve(), transferFrom(), balanceOf(), etc.

mint(address to, uint256 amount) (onlyOwner)

2. Token Faucet

Filename: TokenFaucet.sol
Purpose: Dispense free Platform Tokens to users (for testing).

Requirements:

Only gives Platform Tokens

Users can claim once every 24 hours

Fixed claim amount (e.g., 100 tokens)

Must track:

Total claimed per user

Time until next claim

Prevent abuse (rate limit per address)

Core Functions:

claimTokens() → mints/sends fixed amount

getTimeUntilNextClaim(address user) → returns seconds left

getTotalClaimed(address user) → returns total claimed tokens

Integration:

Calls mint() from PlatformToken

Only Faucet has mint permission

3. Multi-Token DEX

Filename: MultiTokenDEX.sol
Purpose: Decentralized exchange that swaps between at least three tokens.

Required Tokens:

Platform Token

Token A (e.g., “TestUSD”)

Token B (e.g., “TestBTC”)

Required Pools (at least 3):

Platform Token ↔ Token A

Platform Token ↔ Token B

Token A ↔ Token B

Required Features:

Add liquidity to pools

Swap between any tokens with liquidity

Display reserves of pools

Calculate swap previews (getAmountOut)

Show current prices

Core Functions:

addLiquidity(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB)

swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amountIn)

getReserves(address tokenA, address tokenB)

getAmountOut(uint256 amountIn, address tokenIn, address tokenOut)

Integration:

NFT Marketplace uses DEX to calculate token-to-Platform price equivalence.

4. NFT Collection (ERC-721)

Filename: NFTCollection.sol
Purpose: Mint and manage NFTs for the marketplace.

Requirements:

ERC-721 compliant contract

Name and Symbol (your choice)

10–20 NFTs with IPFS metadata

Owner can mint NFTs

Metadata stored on IPFS (Pinata)

Core Functions:

mintNFT(address to) (onlyOwner)

Metadata handling via tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)

Integration:

Marketplace queries this contract for NFT ownership and metadata

5. NFT Marketplace

Filename: NFTMarketplace.sol
Purpose: Handle NFT sales using Platform Token or any supported token (via DEX).

Core Features:

Minting

Owner can mint NFTs via NFTCollection

Set price in Platform Token

Buying with Platform Token

buyNFTWithPlatformToken(uint256 tokenId)

Buying with Other Tokens

User selects any supported token (e.g., Token A)

Marketplace calculates equivalent Platform Token price using DEX reserves

Automatically swaps Token A → Platform Token

Completes NFT purchase

Price Conversion

calculatePriceInToken(address token) → returns equivalent price

listAllNFTs() → returns metadata of available NFTs

Integration:

Uses MultiTokenDEX to get conversion rates and perform swaps

Transfers tokens using approve() mechanism from user wallets

Sends payment in Platform Token to the seller
