# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Contract Configuration Required

## Why is Nothing Showing?

Your frontend is not displaying any information because **the smart contracts haven't been deployed yet**, or the contract addresses in your configuration file are not set.

## Current Status

The contract addresses in `src/config/contract.ts` are currently set to:
```typescript
CLAW_TOKEN_ADDRESS = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
TIGER_TOKEN_ADDRESS = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"  
TOKEN_SWAP_ADDRESS = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```

These are placeholder addresses that point to nothing!

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Deploy Using Remix IDE (Easiest - 5 minutes)

1. **Open Remix IDE**: Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/

2. **Upload Contract Files**:
   - Create new files and copy the code from:
     - `Contract/ClawToken_v2.sol`
     - `Contract/TigerToken_v2.sol`
     - `Contract/TokenSwap_v2.sol`

3. **Compile Contracts**:
   - Select Solidity Compiler (icon on left)
   - Choose compiler version 0.8.20 or higher
   - Click "Compile"

4. **Connect MetaMask**:
   - Install MetaMask if you haven't
   - Switch to Sepolia Testnet (or your preferred network)
   - Get test ETH from https://sepoliafaucet.com/

5. **Deploy in Order**:
   
   **First - ClawToken:**
   - Select "ClawToken" contract
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Save the deployed address
   
   **Second - TigerToken:**
   - Select "TigerToken" contract
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Save the deployed address
   
   **Third - TokenSwap:**
   - Select "TokenSwap" contract
   - Enter the ClawToken and TigerToken addresses in constructor
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Save the deployed address

6. **Update Your Config**:
   Edit `frontend/src/config/contract.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const CLAW_TOKEN_ADDRESS = "0xYourClawAddressHere";
   export const TIGER_TOKEN_ADDRESS = "0xYourTigerAddressHere";
   export const TOKEN_SWAP_ADDRESS = "0xYourSwapAddressHere";
   ```

7. **Restart Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Option 2: Use Existing Deployed Contracts

If you already deployed contracts:
1. Find your deployment transaction on block explorer
2. Copy the contract addresses
3. Update `src/config/contract.ts`
4. Restart the dev server

## After Configuration

Once addresses are set correctly, you should see:

✅ Token name: "Claw" / "Tiger"  
✅ Token symbols: "CLAW" / "TIGER"  
✅ Total supply information  
✅ Your wallet balance  
✅ Swap interface working  
✅ Pool information visible  

## Verification

Run this command to verify contracts are working:
```bash
cd frontend
node verify-contract.js
```

## Still Having Issues?

Make sure:
1. ✅ Contracts are deployed on the same network your wallet is connected to
2. ✅ You have some test ETH in your wallet
3. ✅ Contract addresses are correctly copied (no typos)
4. ✅ You restarted the development server after updating addresses
