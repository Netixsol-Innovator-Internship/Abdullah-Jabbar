# ClawToken Frontend Issues - Summary & Solutions

## Problems Identified

Based on my analysis of your code, the contract **Solidity code is correct** and the **ABI in the frontend is complete**. The issue is most likely one of the following:

### Most Likely Issue: Network Mismatch ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Your contract is deployed on a specific network, but your wallet might be connected to a different network.**

The contract address you have configured is:
```
0xe389811D36f745474d00E1fF3C95E9C87283BaEe
```

Configured networks in your frontend:
- Kasplex Testnet (Chain ID: 167012)
- Sepolia (Chain ID: 11155111)

**You need to verify:**
1. Which network did you deploy your contract to?
2. Is MetaMask connected to that same network?

## What I've Done to Help

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling ‚úÖ
Updated `TokenInfo.tsx` to:
- Show loading states while fetching data
- Display error messages if contract calls fail
- Add console logging for debugging
- Show "N/A" instead of blank when data isn't available

### 2. Created Diagnostic Panel ‚úÖ
Added `DiagnosticPanel.tsx` which shows:
- ‚úÖ Wallet connection status
- üåê Current network and Chain ID
- üìç Contract address being used
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Network compatibility warnings
- üìã Troubleshooting checklist

### 3. Added Debug Console Output ‚úÖ
The TokenInfo component now logs to the browser console:
```javascript
console.log("TokenInfo Debug:", {
  contractAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  chainId,
  name,
  symbol,
  totalSupply: totalSupply?.toString(),
  nameError: nameError?.message,
  symbolError: symbolError?.message,
  supplyError: supplyError?.message,
});
```

### 4. Created Troubleshooting Guide ‚úÖ
Added `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with detailed instructions

## How to Diagnose the Issue

### Step 1: Open the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm run dev
```

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet
1. Click "Connect Wallet" button
2. Select MetaMask
3. Approve the connection

### Step 3: Check the Diagnostic Panel
You'll now see a **yellow "Connection Diagnostics"** panel at the top that shows:
- Your wallet address
- Current network name and Chain ID
- Contract address
- Network compatibility status

### Step 4: Open Browser Console (F12)
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Look for "TokenInfo Debug:" log entry
4. This will show you:
   - What data is being returned from the contract
   - Any error messages
   - The exact contract address and chain being used

## Expected Results

### If Everything is Working ‚úÖ
You should see:
- **Token Name:** "Claw"
- **Symbol:** "CLAW"  
- **Total Supply:** The amount you deployed (e.g., "1,000,000,000.00")
- All diagnostic checks show green ‚úÖ

### If Contract Not Deployed on Current Network ‚ùå
You'll see:
- **Token Name:** "N/A"
- **Symbol:** "N/A"
- **Total Supply:** "0.00"
- Red error box saying "Contract Connection Error"
- Console shows errors about contract not found

### If Wrong Network ‚ö†Ô∏è
The diagnostic panel will show:
- Yellow warning about network compatibility
- Message saying "Unknown network - Please switch to..."
- Current Chain ID doesn't match expected values (167012 or 11155111)

## Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Switch Networks in MetaMask
1. Click MetaMask extension
2. Click network dropdown (at the top)
3. Select the network where you deployed your contract

### Fix 2: Verify Contract Address
If you deployed to a different address:
1. Open `frontend/src/config/contract.ts`
2. Update line 2:
   ```typescript
   export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0xYOUR_ACTUAL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
   ```

### Fix 3: Add Custom Network to MetaMask
If Kasplex Testnet doesn't appear in MetaMask:
1. Click network dropdown in MetaMask
2. Click "Add Network"
3. Enter:
   - **Network Name:** Kasplex Testnet
   - **RPC URL:** https://rpc.kasplextest.xyz
   - **Chain ID:** 167012
   - **Currency Symbol:** KAS
   - **Block Explorer:** https://explorer.testnet.kasplextest.xyz

## Verify Your Contract is Deployed

### Check on Block Explorer:
- **Kasplex Testnet:** https://explorer.testnet.kasplextest.xyz/address/0xe389811D36f745474d00E1fF3C95E9C87283BaEe
- **Sepolia:** https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xe389811D36f745474d00E1fF3C95E9C87283BaEe

If the contract doesn't exist on either network, you need to deploy it first!

## About Supply Format

When you deployed the contract, if you entered:
- `1000000000000000000000000000` (27 zeros) = 1 billion tokens
- `1000000000000000000000000` (24 zeros) = 1 million tokens

The frontend will automatically format this as readable numbers.

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `frontend/src/components/TokenInfo.tsx` - Enhanced with error handling and debugging
2. ‚úÖ `frontend/src/components/DiagnosticPanel.tsx` - New diagnostic panel
3. ‚úÖ `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Added diagnostic panel to main page
4. ‚úÖ `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Detailed troubleshooting guide

## Next Steps

1. **Start the dev server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm run dev
   ```

2. **Open http://localhost:3000** in your browser

3. **Connect your wallet**

4. **Look at the Diagnostic Panel** - it will tell you exactly what's wrong

5. **Check browser console (F12)** for detailed error messages

6. **Follow the troubleshooting steps** based on what you see

## The Issue is NOT:

- ‚ùå Your Solidity contract code (it's correct)
- ‚ùå Missing ABI entries (name, symbol, totalSupply are all there)
- ‚ùå Frontend parsing logic (it's correct)
- ‚ùå Type conversions (formatUnits is used correctly)

## The Issue IS:

- ‚úÖ Most likely: **Network mismatch** or **contract not deployed on current network**
- ‚úÖ Possibly: **Wrong contract address** in config
- ‚úÖ Maybe: **RPC connection issues** with the network

The enhanced error messages and diagnostic panel will help you identify exactly which one!
