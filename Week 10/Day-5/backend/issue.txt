Root Issue Summary

The deployed endpoint is returning a JavaScript file instead of executing the API function ‚Äî meaning Vercel is serving a static asset or not invoking the serverless function.

Detailed Causes to Check
1. Static asset conflict (most common)

A file named index.js exists at the root or inside .vercel/output/static/.

Vercel prioritizes static files over serverless functions, so requests to / return that static file instead of triggering the function at /api/index.js.

Check:

Look for /index.js, /public/index.js, or /api/index.js being copied to .vercel/output/static/.

Inspect .vercel/output/static/ after build.

2. Function not bundled with compiled code

The serverless function (api/index.js) references ../dist/main.server.js, but dist/ isn‚Äôt included in the deployed function bundle.

On Vercel, each function runs in isolation ‚Äî only files inside its bundle are accessible.

If dist/ isn‚Äôt copied or declared in includeFiles, the require('../dist/main.server.js') fails silently and may trigger a fallback route (serving a static file).

Check:

Inside function runtime logs, list available files (fs.readdirSync(__dirname)).

Verify dist/ exists in the bundle.

3. Wrong routing configuration in vercel.json

Routes may point directly to a static file or root ("/(.*)" -> "/index.js") instead of your API function.

If routing points incorrectly, Vercel bypasses the function.

Check:

Ensure "routes": [{ "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/api/index.js" }] (or /api/server.js if renamed).

Verify there are no conflicting route definitions.

4. Function misplacement

If the function file is not located in /api/, Vercel doesn‚Äôt treat it as a serverless function.

Files in root or /src/ aren‚Äôt executed ‚Äî they are uploaded as static files.

Check:

Ensure your entry file is at api/index.js (or renamed version).

Avoid placing index.js in the project root.

5. NestJS static serving misconfiguration

The app might use ServeStaticModule or app.useStaticAssets() in main.ts that serves from the wrong directory (e.g., dist/ or project root).

That exposes your compiled files publicly, causing the browser to receive JS code instead of API responses.

Check:

Search for ServeStaticModule.forRoot or app.useStaticAssets in your codebase.

Ensure it only serves specific client build directories (not the backend dist/ folder).

6. Missing createServer export or failed import

The function requires ../dist/main.server.js and expects a createServer export.

If the compiled file doesn‚Äôt export it correctly, the serverless function initialization may throw and exit silently, and Vercel returns fallback static content.

Check:

Inspect dist/main.server.js to confirm exports.createServer exists.

Log Object.keys(require('../dist/main.server.js')) before usage.

7. Build artifact shadowing function

The NestJS build or pnpm vercel-build script may output files into api/ or the root directory, overwriting the intended index.js function file.

The wrong file is then deployed as a static artifact.

Check:

After pnpm vercel-build, verify what files exist at the project root and inside /api/.

8. Cached deployment or old static output

Vercel caching can serve outdated static builds (X-Vercel-Cache: HIT).

If previous deployments produced a static index.js, the cache might still serve it even after code changes.

Check:

Redeploy with cache invalidation (vercel --force or by editing build command slightly).

Confirm new deployment IDs differ.

9. Incorrect outputDirectory or framework autodetection

If outputDirectory or framework fields in vercel.json mislead Vercel into thinking your app is static (e.g., Next.js or plain Node), it generates a static build output.

Vercel then serves that static output instead of a function.

Check:

Ensure "framework": null and "outputDirectory": ".".

Confirm Vercel detects ‚ÄúOther‚Äù framework in the dashboard, not ‚ÄúNext.js‚Äù.

10. File path resolution failure

On some environments, require('../dist/main.server.js') may resolve incorrectly depending on the runtime folder structure inside Vercel‚Äôs lambda environment.

Check:

Add logging:

console.log('__dirname:', __dirname);
console.log('resolved path:', path.resolve(__dirname, '../dist/main.server.js'));
console.log('exists:', fs.existsSync(path.resolve(__dirname, '../dist/main.server.js')));

11. Uncaught initialization error

If the NestJS initialization throws and is caught by the outer wrapper, your function might not send a valid response, allowing Vercel to respond with a fallback static resource.

Check:

Review function logs for ‚Äú‚ùå Failed to initialize Nest server‚Äù messages.

Ensure your wrapper always returns a proper HTTP response, even on init failure.

12. Static file serving precedence (Vercel rule)

On Vercel, static files always take precedence over serverless functions.
So if any file exists at the same path as your API route, it will be served first.

Check:

No index.js, index.html, or any file at / path in project root or /public.

Recommended Actions
Step	What to Do
1	Rename your function file to /api/server.js to avoid static conflicts.
2	Add "includeFiles": ["dist/**"] under your function in vercel.json.
3	Delete any root index.js or static output from previous builds.
4	Confirm no ServeStaticModule exposes backend files.
5	Redeploy using vercel --force to clear cached static artifacts.
6	Verify function logs show üì® Incoming request on each request.
