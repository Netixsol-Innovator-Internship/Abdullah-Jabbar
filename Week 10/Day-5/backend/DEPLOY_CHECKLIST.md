# Deployment Checklist for Vercel

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **MongoDB Connection Issues**
- Increased connection timeouts for serverless cold starts
- Added connection retry logic
- Optimized connection pool settings for serverless

### 2. **Better Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive logging in `api/index.js`
- Added timeout handling for server initialization
- Improved error messages with timestamps

### 3. **Health Check Endpoint**
- Added `/health` endpoint to monitor database connection
- Shows MongoDB status and environment configuration

### 4. **Serverless Optimizations**
- Increased function memory to 1024MB
- Added binary file handling for PDFs and Excel files
- Improved caching strategy with initialization promise

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and Push Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Serverless deployment issues for Vercel"
git push origin main
```

2. **Verify Environment Variables in Vercel**
Go to your Vercel project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables and ensure these are set:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Gemini API key
- `GEMINI_API_URL` - Gemini API endpoint
- `NODE_ENV=production`

3. **Deploy**
```bash
cd backend
vercel --prod
```

4. **Test the Deployment**
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/health

# Test root endpoint
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/

# Test assignments endpoint
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/assignments
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Still Loading Forever
**Solution**: Check Vercel function logs for MongoDB connection errors. Verify MONGODB_URI is correct.

### Issue: 500 Error
**Solution**: Check `/health` endpoint to see database connection status.

### Issue: Cold Start Timeout
**Solution**: The timeout is now set to 25 seconds. If still timing out, check MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist (set to 0.0.0.0/0 for Vercel).

## MongoDB Atlas Configuration

Ensure your MongoDB Atlas is configured for serverless:
1. Go to Network Access
2. Add IP: `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow from anywhere) - Required for Vercel
3. Or add specific Vercel IPs if you have them

## Monitoring

Check logs in Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Select your deployment
4. Click "Functions" tab
5. View real-time logs

Look for:
- ‚úÖ "Nest server created and cached successfully"
- üîå "Attempting MongoDB connection..."
- ‚ùå Any error messages
