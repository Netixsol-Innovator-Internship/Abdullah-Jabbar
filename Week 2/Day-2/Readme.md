# Daily Learning Log â€“ DOM, JavaScript & Tailwind CSS (Aug 5, 2025)

## Overview

Today was focused on deepening my understanding of front-end development, particularly around DOM manipulation using JavaScript and building interactive UI components with Tailwind CSS. I worked on several small but interconnected features and refined both the functionality and code readability of a notifications interface.

## ðŸ”§ Key Concepts Covered

### 1. **DOM Manipulation with JavaScript**

- Used `document.querySelectorAll`, `getElementById`, and `addEventListener` to attach interactivity.
- Updated attributes (`setAttribute`) and inner content (`textContent`) dynamically.
- Explored different ways to write functions â€” converted arrow functions to traditional `function` syntax for readability.
- Practiced toggling classes (`classList.add`, `remove`, `toggle`) to reflect UI states like "read" vs "unread".

### 2. **Event Handling**

- Implemented a "Mark all as read" button that updated the read status of each notification.
- Attached individual click handlers to list items to toggle their read state on click.
- Ensured the notification counter updates correctly in real-time.

### 3. **Debugging UI Glitches**

- Identified and fixed unintended visual borders caused by `shadow-sm` in Tailwind.
- Differentiated between shadows and outlines, and learned how to use `focus:outline-none` when needed.

### 4. **Tailwind CSS Utility Usage**

- Fine-tuned UI using utility classes like `bg-blue-50`, `hover:bg-blue-100`, `rounded-lg`, and `transition-transform`.
- Cleaned up hover and focus states to improve UX.
- Structured responsive elements and examined what triggers layout issues like horizontal scroll.
