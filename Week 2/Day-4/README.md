# Tip Calculator

This is a responsive, modern **Tip Calculator** web app built with **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It helps users quickly calculate the tip and total amount per person based on the bill, selected tip percentage, and number of people.

## Features

- **Real-time Calculation**  
  Updates the tip and total per person instantly as inputs change.

- **Preset and Custom Tips**  
  Choose from predefined tip percentages (5%, 10%, 15%, 25%, 50%) or enter a custom value.

- **Input Validation**  
  Alerts users if the number of people is invalid (e.g., less than 1).

- **Responsive Design**  
  Works well on both desktop and mobile screens.

- **Accessible UI**  
  Clear labels, focus outlines, and good color contrast for usability.

- **Reset Functionality**  
  A single click clears all inputs and results.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Structure and content
- **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN) — Styling and layout
- **JavaScript** — Dynamic behavior and calculations
- **Google Fonts** — Uses *Space Mono* for a modern, clean aesthetic

## Tailwind Configuration

The Tailwind setup includes customizations:

- **Color Palette**:  
  Custom green and gray shades for consistent UI theming.

- **Font**:  
  `Space Mono` for a monospace look and feel.

- **Utilities**:  
  Common patterns like `.tip-btn`, `.input-field`, and `.custom-tip-input` use `@apply` for reuse and clarity.
