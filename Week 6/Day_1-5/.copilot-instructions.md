# Copilot Instructions

These are project-specific guidelines for Copilot:

1. **Ports**
   - Frontend runs on **http://localhost:3000**
   - Backend runs on **http://localhost:4000**
   - Assume both are already running unless explicitly told otherwise.  
     â†’ Do **not** suggest running them again.

2. **Terminal**
   - Always provide commands for **PowerShell**.
   - Do **not** provide Bash, zsh, or Linux/macOS commands.
   - Example: use `Get-Process`, `Stop-Process`, `Start-Job`, `Set-ExecutionPolicy` when needed.
   - Commands should be executable directly in PowerShell without translation.

3. **General**
   - If suggesting API calls, use the above ports.
   - Prefer to check existing terminal outputs/logs instead of re-running servers.
