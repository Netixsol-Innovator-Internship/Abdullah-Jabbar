## What I Learned

- **HTML structuring**: Organized content into semantic sections (`header`, `section`, `article`) for clarity and accessibility.
- **CSS layout techniques**: Implemented responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid.
- **Icon and image handling**: Embedded icons with proper alt attributes to enhance visual appeal and accessibility.
- **Typography and spacing**: Controlled line heights, spacing, and font weights to achieve clean readability.
- **Responsive design**: Made the layout adjust to smaller screen sizes using `meta viewport` and flexible units.
- **Project structuring**: Maintained a clear separation between content (`index.html`) and styling (`styles.css`).

This task helped solidify my understanding of building clean, structured, and responsive personal websites.
