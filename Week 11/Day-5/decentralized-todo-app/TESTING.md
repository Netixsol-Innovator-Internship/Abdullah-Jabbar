## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests failing after contract changes:**
```bash
npm run clean
npm run compile
npm run test
```

**Coverage not generating:**
```bash
# Ensure solidity-coverage is installed
npm install --save-dev solidity-coverage
npx hardhat coverage
```

**Gas reporting not working:**
```bash
# Set environment variable
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```

**Out of memory errors:**
```bash
# Increase Node.js memory limit
node --max-old-space-size=8192 ./node_modules/.bin/hardhat test
```
