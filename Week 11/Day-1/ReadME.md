# Blockchain Fundamentals

ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Build a solid conceptual foundation of blockchain technology by understanding its structure, underlying principles, and real-world applications.

---

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

### 1. What is Blockchain
- Structure of blocks and how they form chains  
- How data is securely stored and linked through cryptographic hashes  
- The concept of immutability and transparency in blockchain systems  

### 2. Decentralization & Peer-to-Peer Networks
- Difference between centralized and decentralized systems  
- Role of peer-to-peer (P2P) communication in blockchain  
- How nodes maintain a shared and synchronized ledger  

### 3. Consensus Mechanisms
- **Proof of Work (PoW):** Mining, difficulty, and energy trade-offs  
- **Proof of Stake (PoS):** Validators, staking, and energy efficiency  
- Comparison of major consensus models and their use cases  

### 4. Cryptography Basics
- **Hashing:** SHA-256, hash properties, and block linking  
- **Digital Signatures:** Private/public keys, identity verification  
- Importance of cryptographic integrity in blockchain security  

### 5. Bitcoin & Ethereum
- **Bitcoin:** Digital currency, UTXO model, and PoW consensus  
- **Ethereum:** Smart contracts, DApps, and PoS transition  
- Differences in purpose, architecture, and ecosystem

## âœ… Summary

This task provided a conceptual overview of blockchain, focusing on how distributed ledgers ensure security, trust, and transparency without a central authority.  
Understanding these fundamentals sets the stage for exploring **smart contracts, dApps, and blockchain development frameworks** in the next phase.
